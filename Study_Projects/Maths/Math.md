# Math Commonly Use During Analyses
## Algebra
There are three kinds of algebra:
- Elementary
- Linear (Matrix) 
- Systems of Linear Equations

In elementary algebra, you have one or multiple variables that will affect the equation. An example is shown below:

$$ y = {B<sub>0</sub>+B<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1i</sub>+B<sub>2</sub>x<sub>2i</sub> \pm E<sub>i</sub>} $$
where E<sub>i</sub> is the error in our calculation.
