## Algebra
There are three kinds of algebra:
- Elementary
- Linear (Matrix) 
- Systems of Linear Equations

In elementary algebra, you have one or multiple variables that will affect the equation. An example is shown below:

$$y_i = {B_0+B_1X_{1i}+B_2X_{2i}+B_3X_{3i} \pm E_i}$$

- *E<sub>i</sub>* is the error in our calculation, or how far we expect the calculation to be from the real value.
- Each *B* in this equation is a coefficient of a variable.
- The *i*s in the equation represent which observation we are working with (person, location, product, etc.).
- The *X* values represent each observation's value for that variable (score, price, etc.).

In linear algebra (also known as matrix algebra), there are certain terms we need to know:
- Scalar: One number.
- Vector: One row or column of numbers that can be treated as a collection. Can be thought of as a variable.
- Matrix: Many rows and columns organized in a two-dimensional shape.

An example of a linear algebra equation is shown below:

$$\left\lbrack\matrix{y_1 \cr y_2}\right\rbrack = \left\lbrack\matrix{1 & X_{11} & X_{21} & X_{31} \cr 1 & X_{12} & X_{22} & X_{32}}\right\rbrack*\left\lbrack\matrix{B_0 \cr B_1 \cr B_2 \cr B_3}\right\rbrack + \left\lbrack\matrix{E_1 \cr E_2}\right\rbrack$$
