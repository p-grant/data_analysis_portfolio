# Math Commonly Use During Analyses
## Algebra
There are three kinds of algebra:
- Elementary
- Linear (Matrix) 
- Systems of Linear Equations

In elementary algebra, you have one or multiple variables that will affect the equation. An example is shown below:

$$y_i = {B_0+B_1*X_1i+B_2*X_2i+B_3*X_3i \pm E_i}$$

where E is the error in our calculation.
