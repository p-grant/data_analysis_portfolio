# Math Commonly Use During Analyses
## Algebra
There are three kinds of algebra:
- Elementary
- Linear (Matrix) 
- Systems of Linear Equations

In elementary algebra, you have one or multiple variables that will affect the equation. An example is shown below:

$$y_i = {B_0+B_1X_{1i}+B_2X_{2i}+B_3X_{3i} \pm E_i}$$

- *E<sub>i</sub>* is the error in our calculation, or how far we expect the calculation to be from the real value.
- Each *B* in this equation is a coefficient of a variable.
- The *i*s in the equation represent which observation we are working with (person, location, product, etc.).
- The *X* values represent each observation's value for that variable (score, price, etc.).
