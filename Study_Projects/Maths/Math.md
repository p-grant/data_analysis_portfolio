# Math Commonly Use During Analyses
## Algebra
There are three kinds of algebra:
- Elementary
- Linear (Matrix) 
- Systems of Linear Equations

In elementary algebra, you have one or multiple variables that will affect the equation. An example is shown below:

$$y_i = {B_0+B_1X_{1i}+B_2X_{2i}+B_3X_{3i} \pm E_i}$$

where E<sub>i</sub> is the error in our calculation.
