# R Programming
R is a programming language frequently used for statistical analysis, visualization and other data analyses.
## Using and Accessing Files
To create a new folder or directory to hold your files, use:
```R
dir.create(“folder_name”)
```
To create a blank file, use:
```R
file.create(“file_name.type”)
```
Typically, files will be in the form of a .txt, .docx, or .csv file.

To copy a file, use:
```R
file.copy(“file_name.type”, “destination_folder”)
```
Delete R files using:
```R
unlink(“file_name.type”)
```
