# Tableau
Tableau: A business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people see, understand, and make decisions with data.

Drag Tables into Marks to begin building your table.
- You can drag a table into Labels to put Labels on your viz.

You can add filters to your viz by dragging tables into the filter box and selecting how you want the filter to work.

You can focus on certain areas by boxing them in with your mouse, or by using lasso to outline a custom area.
- By selecting keep only, this applies a filter that limits the areas shown to those you selected.
- If you are using a color scheme, this will change the colors so the scale is relevant to only those areas.

You can hover over an area to see the specific information related to it.

We can change the way values in a table are represented in the table (whole vs. decimal numbers).

We can make a sliding filter by adding a table to our filters and selecting the show filter option underneath it.

Tableau Chart Types: Highlight Tables, Heatmaps, Density Maps, Gantt Charts, Symbol Maps, Filled Maps, Circle Views, Box Plots (Box and Whisker Charts),
Bullet Graphs, Packed Bubble Charts.

The symbols corresponding to rows of data represent the type of data:
- #: Numeric Data
- Abc: String Data
- Globe: Geographic Data
- Calendar: Date
- Calendar with clock: Date and Time

The banner with column names on the left side of the sheet contains the dimensions of the data. Below the grey line are the different measures that
we can track for the dimensions.

After adding a dimension to the viz, we can double click a measure to affect the size of the dots on the viz.

We can drag and drop measurements to the column or row bar to create more kinds of graphs.

We can duplicate a sheet by right clicking on it and duplicating it.

Populate a dashboard by dragging your visualizations into it.

Linking multiple datasets: 
- Use JOINS to relate datasets. Drag tables next to one another in your sheet and define the 	relationships.

Tableau Dashboards: Used to track and analyze the status of a project or company by monitoring live, incoming data.

Tiled items are part of a single-layer grid that automatically resizes based on the overall dashboard size. Floating items can be layered over other objects.

Click or Click and drag on the viz to select data points and then select exclude to hide them. You can also select values to remove directly from the data table.
