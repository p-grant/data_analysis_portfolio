# Data Analysis Portfolio
This is a collection of my data analysis and study projects.

## About
Hello, I'm Paul! I am a recent graduate of St. Lawrence University where I studied physics. During my time there, I gained a love for collecting and analyizng data. I became skilled at seeking out and learning to use unique, efficient tools for cleaning, transforming and presenting data. These tools include programming languages such as Python, R, JavaScript, relational database querying with SQL, visualization tools such as Tableau, and many more. I am hoping to break into the professional data analytics field so that I can begin a career I love, while growing my analytical toolbox.

This is a collection of my data analysis and study projects that I have completed so far.

## Case Studies
### Superstore Analysis
To begin exploring data analysis, I decided to analyze a dataset that describes the orders made from an imaginary superstore.
