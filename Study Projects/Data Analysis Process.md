Data life cycle: 
- Plan
- Capture
- Manage
- Analyze
- Archive
- Destroy.

As a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. It is important to analyze data for bias and credibility.
- Sampling Bias: When a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole.
- Observer Bias: The tendency for people to observe things differently. 
- Interpretation Bias: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way.
- Confirmation Bias: The tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.

Structured thinking is the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options.

Six common types of problems: 
- Making Predictions
- Categorizing Things

    - The most common accepted confidence level is 95%.
  - Margin-of-error: The amount a sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if the entire population had been surveyed. The maximum that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population.

A business task is the question or problem data analysis answers for business.

ROI, or Return on Investment is essentially a formula designed using metrics that let a business know how well an investment is doing.
- Made up of two metrics, the net profit over a period of time and the cost of investment.

Growth per Year = Current Year – Previous Year

% Growth per Year = Growth per Year / Previous Year

Profit Margin: A percentage that indicates how many cents of profit have been generated for each dollar of sale.
