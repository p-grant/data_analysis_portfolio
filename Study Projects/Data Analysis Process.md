As a data analyst, you want to help create systems that are fair and inclusive to everyone. It is important to analyze data for bias and credibility.
- Sampling Bias: When a sample isn't representative of the population as a whole.
- Observer Bias: The tendency for people to observe things differently. 
- Interpretation Bias: The tendency to always interpret ambiguous situations in a positive, or negative way.
- Confirmation Bias: The tendency to search for, or interpret information in a way that confirms preexisting beliefs.
