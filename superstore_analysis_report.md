# Superstore Analysis Report
To familiarize myself with data analysis techniques, I decided to analyze a public dataset. The dataset I will use can be found on [Tableau Public's website](https://public.tableau.com/app/resources/sample-data) and it includes data regarding the products, sales and profits of an imaginary superstore. This document describes the process I took when analyzing this data and the results of this analysis.
## The Data
The data was borrowed from Tableau's collection of sample data. After downloading the file and opening it in Excel, I noticed that there were three sheets, titled *Orders*, *Returns*, and *People*. The *Orders* sheet contains information regarding 9994 orders made from the superstore. This includes information regarding: 
- Relevant dates
- Customers
- Products
- Sale Prices, Discounts and Profits

The *Returns* sheet includes a list of Order ID numbers. There is not a description describing what this information means, and I am not able to contact the person who provided the information, so I will assume this sheet provides a list of the orders which were returned to the superstore. The *People* sheet has four names, each of which is attributed to a region. I must assume that these are meant to be the names of people in charge of overseeing orders from each region.
